# Utils

Utils is a C\# class library. It provides several utilities that maybe useful in Windows Forms applications. These include info, warning, error, and exception dialogs, and a C# replacement for MessageBox, which is a native application. The class library has versions for .NET 5 and for .NET Framework 4.7. Utils.dll is found in one of the bin/Release directories. Use the version appropriate to the Target Framework you are using in your application by adding it as a reference for your project.
