# Utils

Utils is a C\# class library. It provides utiltities that tend to be needed in more than one project. You can use it in a project by including Utils.dll from the bin directory as a reference.

This repository has a C# solution with the class library **Utils** project and a Winforms demo project **Utils Demo** that demonstrates the usage of the classes in the library.

The following classes are included in **Utils**:

## Utils

This class primarily provides error handling by bringing up an appropriate dialog.

It includes:

-   void infoMsg(string msg)
-   void warmMsg(string msg)
-   void errMsg(string msg)
-   void Msg(string msg, Exception ex)
-   Size getDpiAdjustedSize(Form form, Size size)

## AboutBox

This is a class that provides an About dialog. It has an image and is
designed to use information such as ProductName, Version, Copyright, CompanyName, and Description from the Assembly.

**Usage example:**

        Assembly assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
        Image image = null; 
        try { 
            image = Image.FromFile(@".\Help\UtilsDemo.256x256.png");
        } catch (Exception ex) { 
            Utils.excMsg("Failed to get AbutBox image", ex);
        }
        AboutBox dlg = new AboutBox("About Utils Demo", image, assembly);  
        dlg.ShowDialog();

## ScrolledTextDialog

This is a dialog that displays scrolled text. It has Clear, Cancel, and
Ok buttons. It can be used as both modal and modeless.

**Modless Example**

        private static ScrolledTextDialog scrolledText;

        DateTime now = new DateTime();
        if (scrolledText == null) {
            scrolledText = new ScrolledTextDialog(
                Utils.getDpiAdjustedSize(this, new Size(400, 400)),
                "Start of Scrolled Text");
            scrolledText.appendTextAndNL("OnScrolledTextClick (First Time)" + now);
        }
        scrolledText.ButtonCancel.Visible = false;
        scrolledText.appendTextAndNL(NL + "OnScrolledTextClick " + now);
        scrolledText.Visible = true; 

**Modal Example**

        string msg = "Some information;
        ScrolledTextDialog dlg = new ScrolledTextDialog(
        Utils.getDpiAdjustedSize(this, new Size(400, 400)),
            "Example Scrolled Text");
        dlg.appendText(msg);
        DialogResult res = dlg.ShowDialog();
        if (res == DialogResult.OK) {
            Utils.infoMsg("You clicked OK");
        } else if (res == DialogResult.Cancel) {
            Utils.infoMsg("You clicked Cancel");
        }

## ScrolledHtmlDialog

This is a dialog that displays an HTMLweb page as would be used for an
Overview item on the Help menu. It is assumed there is a folder named
Help in the bin directory which has files Overview.html as well as
images, CSS, and other items as needed by Overview.html. The dialog is a
simple web browser with Back and Forward buttons. It can follow links.

**Usage Example**

        private static ScrolledHTMLDialog overviewDlg;
      
        if (overviewDlg == null) {
            MainForm app = (MainForm)FindForm().FindForm();
            overviewDlg = new ScrolledHTMLDialog(
                Utils.getDpiAdjustedSize(app, new Size(800, 600)),
                "Overview");
            overviewDlg.Show();
        } else {
            overviewDlg.Visible = true;
        }

## MessageDialog

This is a class that duplicates much of what MessageBox does. Much of
the implementation is heavily borrowed from FlexibleMessageBox:\

 Features:
 - It can be simply used instead of MessageBox since all important
static "Show" methods are supported
 - It can be resized and the content is correctly word-wrapped
 - It tries to auto-size the width to show the longest text row
 - It never exceeds the current desktop working area
 - It displays a vertical scrollbar when needed
 - It supports hyperlinks in text

MessageDialog is a different implementation from FlexibleMessageBox. The interface is a little more different from MessageBox and there is a context menu. Some issues with FlexibleMessageBox have been fixed. These include 

- Not allowing resize beyond the maximum width and height factors
- Not compensating for wrapped lines in calculating the size 

Because the interface is identical to MessageBox, you can add
MessageDialog to your project and use the it almost everywhere you use a
standard MessageBox. It is only necessary to change the class name.

It has a context menu for Copy unlike MessageBox, and Copy only copies
the text, not what Ctrl-C does in MessageBox.. It does not center on the
screen as does MessageBox, and the layout and default font are a little
different from MessageBox.

There are static fields for FONT, MAX\_WIDTH\_FACTOR, and
MAX\_HEIGHT\_Factor that can be used to override the defaults.

**Usage examples:**

        MessageDialog.Show("Some text");

        MessageDialog.Show("Some text", "A caption");

        MessageDialog.Show("Some text with a link: www.google.com",
            "Some caption",
            MessageBoxButtons.AbortRetryIgnore, 
            MessageBoxIcon.Information, 
            MessageBoxDefaultButton.Button2);

        var dialogResult = MessageDialog.Show(
            "Do you know the answer to life the universe and everything?",
            "One short question", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo);
